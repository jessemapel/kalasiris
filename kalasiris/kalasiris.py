    aren't ISIS programs.

    in that directory corresponds to the name of an ISIS program,

# TODO: the above is very heavyweight.  Everytime we load kalasiris, we
# burn through the $ISISROOT/bin directory and make an entry for every
# program.  Can I smartly use __getattr__ and __getattribute__ to just
# have it build an entry when someone tries to use the name?
# Maybe like this:
# __name__.__getattr__(self, name):
#     if name in _get_isis_program_names():
#         # rewrite _build_isis_fn() to return its isis_fn()
#         return(_build_isis_fn(name))
#     else:
#         raise AttributeError
#
# I think this is close to the right function, but not sure if I can
# override.  Maybe I do need to redefine like this:
# class _kalasiris(object):
#     def __getatter__(self, name): # as above
#
# sys.modules[__name__] = _kalasiris()
