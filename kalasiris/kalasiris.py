    This is the pattern that ISIS uses for arguments.  If there are
    any trailing underbars (_) on the key, they will be stripped
    off.  This supports the old Pysis syntax to protect Python
    reserved words like from and min, while still allowing the user

def _get_isis_program_names():
    '''Returns an iterable of ISIS program names.

    With the new conda distribution, there is a lot of stuff in
    $ISISROOT/bin that isn't actually an ISIS program.  It would
    be nice if there was some smart, automatic way to just get ISIS
    program names, but at the moment, we just slurp up all the names
    in $ISISROOT/bin and make functions for them.

    So somebody could try and run ``isis.python('my.py')``, but it
    would end up calling ``python from=my.py`` in the shell which
    would error, but the possibility for mischeif exists.

    This also means that the list this function returns is almost
    a thousand elements long.  And while you can

    ::

        import kalasiris as isis

    programs are strongly encouraged to limit what they import like this::

        from kalasiris import cam2map, hist

    '''
    bindir = os.path.join(environ['ISISROOT'], 'bin')
    with os.scandir(bindir) as it:
        for entry in it:
            if entry.is_file() and os.access(entry, os.X_OK):
                yield entry.name


# Now use the builder function to automatically create functions
# with these names:
for p in _get_isis_program_names():
    _build_isis_fn(p)


# kalasiris-wrapped versions, alphabetically arranged.
# These we want to be able to call or return differently than
# _build_isis_fn() provides.  They all end in '_k'.
# Maybe move them out to another file?

def getkey_k(cube, group, key):
    '''Simplified calling for getkey.

    No default parameters are needed, and it directly returns a string.
    '''
    return(getkey(cube,  # noqa: F821
                  grpname=group,
                  keyword=key).stdout.strip())


def hi2isis_k(img, **kwargs):
    '''Creates a default name for the to= cube.'''
    if 'to' not in kwargs:
        kwargs['to'] = os.path.splitext(img)[0] + '.cub'
